# Metis â€“ AI-Powered College Course Assistant

---

## Project Overview

Metis is an AI-powered web application designed to assist college students with course planning and registration. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), Metis leverages a large language model (LLM) via Ollama to deliver personalized course recommendations based on a student's academic history, preferences, and interests. The platform features an intuitive interface that visualizes course prerequisites as an interactive graph, helping students understand dependencies between classes. By streamlining the planning process and reducing the time spent navigating course catalogs, Metis enables users to make more informed academic decisions with ease and confidence.
